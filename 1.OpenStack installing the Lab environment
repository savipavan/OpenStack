Lab Environment ( Single Node)

Virtualization Host CentOS 7.2 KVM (192.168.56.1) --> Packstack Centos 7 (192.168.56.5)4

Lab Evnironment (Multi-Node)
Virtualization Host CentOS 7.2 KVM (192.168.56.1)
Virtual Machine 1 : Controller - Ubuntu 14.04 (192.168.56.6)
Virtual Machine 2 : Compute  - Ubuntu 14.04 (192.168.56.7)

Single Node - PackStack : Installing OpenStack is time consuming and laborious. It is also not a requirement for the exam. So for the COA series we will use PackStack to install OpenStack in a single-node environment. This is simple and reliable.

The default install does not allow connectivity to the outside world. TO overcome this we add a few customizations into the install.

Multi-Node Manual Install : When i was first learning OpenStack I was frustrated by automated installers and wanted to understand the installprocess. For this reason we include a manual install of Openstack on ubuntu.

We will, however use the Packstack install for the main COA series. This makes the manual install optional, whereas, the PackStack install is mandatory if you are to follow the subsequent courses.

2.2 Preparing the install of OpenStack with PackStack
----------------------------------------------------

Start with a Minimal install of CentOS 7
- We will start with a minimal install of CentOS 7 without any GUI. The VM or physical hardware requires 20GB Disk and 4GB RAM. Configured with a static IP Address. Then stop firewalld and Network Manager and ensure the network service is running.

# systemctl disable firewalld NetworkManager
# systemctl stop firewalld NetworkManager
# systemctl start network
# systemctl enable network

Set-up Repos
 - We use the Liberty release of OpenStack to match the current Spring 2017 Exam
 
 # yum install -y centos-release-openstack-liberty
 # yum install -y back-completion vim epel - release
 # yum upgrade -y
 # reboot
 
 # yum install -y openstack-packstack
 
 Create Answer File and Start Intall
 
 #We can set parameters for the install in the answer file. We can edit this with vim or use sed. A script is provided within the exercise files using sed to edit the answer file. Allow up to 1 hour for the install or ore depending on hardware
 
 # packstack --gen-answer-file=/root/answers.txt
 # vim answers.txt or use sed
 # packstack --answer-file=/root/answers/txt
 
 Check for KVM SUpport:
 - Your Hardware or virtual machine may or may not support KVM as a hypervisor. We have the choice of qumu or kvm. The default is qemu but if we support KVM we need to change the setting.
 
 # grep -Ec '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo # 0 =qemu >=1 =kvm
 # If KVM is supported edit /etc/nova/nova.conf
 # systemctl restart openstack-nova-compute-service
